### Abstract
Our analysis is related to social good by showing the cost of healthcare and healthcare spending. In further discussion, we can expand our idea of the outcome of healthcare and compare U.S. healthcare system with other countries. Furthermore, health care expense takes up a significant portion of GDP and it is affecting our consumption of other goods.

For supervised learning, the pairs graph shows status and income are slightly correlated to each other. We use ‘max’ as our main scope and constructed a null model to explore what range of income has the maximum percentage of overall income. In logistic regression model, we used regularization to decrease the variance and got the upper and lower bound of probability of ‘max’. Finally, the decision tree assign status variable to individual observations.

For unsupervised learning, we clustered the data according to year. We also did k-mean clustering and separate data into 8 groups.

Last but not least, we did a simulation by bootstraping income dataset. This shows us how much of insurance take up in the income of each class.
